# INTRODUCTION
 “What movie should I watch this evening?”
 Have you ever had to answer this question at least once when you came home from 
work? As for me—yes, and more than once.
 This project aims to build a movie recommendation system by analyzing patterns in how 
users rate different movies, then suggesting the top 5 movies that a user is most likely to 
enjoy therefore increasing engagement for streaming platforms
# Data Overview
 This dataset utilizes information from IMDb and 
TMDb and describes 5-star rating and free-text 
tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie 
recommendation service. It contains 100,836 
ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9742 
movies
# Project Objectives
 
 - Create a movie 
recommendation 
system.
 
 - Predict the rating that a 
user would give to a 
movie that he has not 
yet rated.
- Minimize the difference 
between predicted and 
actual rating (RMSE and 
MAE
# Exploratory Data Analysis
# Distribution of user rating count

   We can see that most users rate 
very few movies, and few users 
rate many movies.
 This shows that the dataset has a 
lot of users with little interaction

From this plot, it is evident that, 
very many movies have few 
ratings while few movies have 
many ratings.

 Most movies recieve a rating of 4.0 
followed by 3.0. 
It is possible that users are generous 
with their ratings, giving a 3 if they 
don't really like a movie, 4 if the movie 
was alright and 5 if they really enjoyed 
the movie
