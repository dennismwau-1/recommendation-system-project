# INTRODUCTION
 “What movie should I watch this evening?”
 Have you ever had to answer this question at least once when you came home from 
work? As for me—yes, and more than once.
 This project aims to build a movie recommendation system by analyzing patterns in how 
users rate different movies, then suggesting the top 5 movies that a user is most likely to 
enjoy therefore increasing engagement for streaming platforms
# Data Overview
 This dataset utilizes information from IMDb and 
TMDb and describes 5-star rating and free-text 
tagging activity from MovieLens, a movie 
recommendation service. It contains 100,836 
ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9742 
movies
# Project Objectives
 
 - Create a movie 
recommendation 
system.
 
 - Predict the rating that a 
user would give to a 
movie that he has not 
yet rated.
- Minimize the difference 
between predicted and 
actual rating (RMSE and 
MAE
